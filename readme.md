`ffmpreg` is a rust-native multimedia toolkit that decodes, transforms, and
encodes audio and video without requiring FFmpeg. It provides both a
command-line interface and a library API, allowing you to process media files
directly from the terminal or integrate media processing into Rust applications.
The project aims to deliver a safe, deterministic, and modular media processing
engine with a focus on explicit pipelines and developer control.

## Installation

To install the command-line tool, run:

```bash
cargo install ffmpreg
```

This downloads and compiles `ffmpreg`, placing the binary in your Cargo bin
directory.

To use `ffmpreg` as a library in your Rust project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`
dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
ffmpreg = "0.1"
```

## Getting Started

The simplest operation is transcoding a file from one format to another. For
example, reading a WAV file and writing it back:

```bash
ffmpreg -i input.wav -o output.wav
```

You can apply transforms to modify the media during processing. Transforms
execute in the order they appear and can perform operations such as gain
adjustment or normalization:

```bash
ffmpreg -i input.wav -o output.wav --apply gain=2.0 --apply normalize
```

To inspect a media file without transcoding, use the `--show` flag. This prints
frame-level metadata, similar to `ffprobe`, including timing, sample count,
channel configuration, and sample rate:

```bash
ffmpreg -i input.wav --show
```

Output example:

```
Frame 0: pts=0, samples=1024, channels=2, rate=44100
Frame 1: pts=1024, samples=1024, channels=2, rate=44100
```

Batch processing is supported using glob patterns. Each file is processed
independently, enabling parallel execution:

```bash
ffmpreg -i "folder/*.wav" -o out/
```

## Library

The library exposes the same primitives used internally by the CLI. A pipeline
reads packets from a container, decodes them into frames, optionally applies
transforms, encodes the frames, and writes them to an output container.

Example WAV transcoding pipeline:

```rust
use ffmpreg::container::{WavReader, WavWriter};
use ffmpreg::codecs::{PcmDecoder, PcmEncoder};
use ffmpreg::core::{Decoder, Encoder, Demuxer, Muxer, Timebase};
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let input = File::open("input.wav")?;
    let mut reader = WavReader::new(input)?;
    let format = reader.format();

    let output = File::create("output.wav")?;
    let mut writer = WavWriter::new(output, format)?;

    let mut decoder = PcmDecoder::new(format);
    let mut encoder = PcmEncoder::new(Timebase::new(1, format.sample_rate));

    while let Some(packet) = reader.read_packet()? {
        if let Some(frame) = decoder.decode(packet)? {
            if let Some(out_packet) = encoder.encode(frame)? {
                writer.write_packet(out_packet)?;
            }
        }
    }

    writer.finalize()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Core Concepts

Media processing revolves around two main data types: `Packet` and `Frame`. A
`Packet` represents encoded data in a container, while a `Frame` represents
decoded data ready for processing or playback. Data flows predictably: readers
demux containers into packets, decoders convert packets into frames, transforms
modify frames, encoders convert frames back into packets, and writers mux
packets into output files.

Example `Frame` structure:

```rust
pub struct Frame {
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub pts: i64,
    pub timebase: Timebase,
    pub sample_rate: u32,
    pub channels: u8,
    pub nb_samples: usize,
}
```

Example `Packet` structure:

```rust
pub struct Packet {
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub pts: i64,
    pub dts: i64,
    pub timebase: Timebase,
    pub stream_index: usize,
}
```

## Transforms

Transforms modify frames in the pipeline. Built-in transforms include `Gain` for
multiplying sample amplitudes and `Normalize` for scaling samples to a target
peak.

Example of applying transforms:

```rust
use ffmpreg::transform::{Gain, Normalize};
use ffmpreg::core::Transform;

let mut gain = Gain::new(2.0);
let mut normalize = Normalize::new(0.95);

let frame = decoder.decode(packet)?.unwrap();
let frame = gain.apply(frame)?;
let frame = normalize.apply(frame)?;
```

Custom transforms can be implemented by the `Transform` trait:

```rust
pub struct Invert;

impl Transform for Invert {
    fn apply(&mut self, mut frame: Frame) -> Result<Frame> {
        for i in (0..frame.data.len()).step_by(2) {
            let sample = i16::from_le_bytes([frame.data[i], frame.data[i + 1]]);
            let inverted = (-sample).to_le_bytes();
            frame.data[i] = inverted[0];
            frame.data[i + 1] = inverted[1];
        }
        Ok(frame)
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "invert"
    }
}
```

CLI transforms are specified as `name=value` pairs:

```bash
ffmpreg -i input.wav -o output.wav --apply gain=1.5 --apply normalize=0.9
```

## Formats

- **WAV**: uncompressed audio, suitable for lossless pipelines.
- **Y4M**: raw video frames with a text-based header.

Codecs:

- **PCM**: uncompressed 16-bit audio, multi-channel support.
- **ADPCM**: adaptive differential audio compression.
- **Raw video**: passes through YUV frame data unchanged.

Video processing follows the same pipeline as audio:

```rust
use ffmpreg::container::{Y4mReader, Y4mWriter};
use ffmpreg::codecs::{RawVideoDecoder, RawVideoEncoder};

let input = File::open("input.y4m")?;
let mut reader = Y4mReader::new(input)?;
let output = File::create("output.y4m")?;
let mut writer = Y4mWriter::new(output, reader.format().clone())?;
```

Format metadata is accessible via the reader:

```rust
let format = reader.format();
println!("Resolution: {}x{}", format.width, format.height);
println!("Frame rate: {}/{}", format.framerate_num, format.framerate_den);
```

## CLI Reference

- `-i`: input file or glob pattern.
- `-o`: output file or directory.
- `--show`: inspection mode, prints frame metadata.
- `--apply`: add transform to pipeline (multiple allowed).
- `--codec`: select output codec (default matches input).

## Goals

`ffmpreg` aims to be a safe, reliable, and maintainable Rust-native alternative
to FFmpeg. The project emphasizes deterministic and explicit pipelines, clear
developer control, and minimal runtime surprises. All development prioritizes
safety by avoiding `unsafe` code wherever possible, minimizing `unwrap`
usage, reducing panics, and keeping external dependencies to a minimum. The
goal is to provide a high-performance media processing engine that is easy to
understand, integrate, and extend while maintaining strong Rust safety
guarantees.
